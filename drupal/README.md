# Ansible Vagrant profile for Drupal

## Background

Vagrant and VirtualBox (or some other VM provider) can be used to quickly build or rebuild virtual servers.

This Vagrant profile installs [Drupal](https://drupal.org/) using the [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) provisioner.

## Getting Started

This README file is inside a folder that contains a `Vagrantfile` (hereafter this folder shall be called the [vagrant_root]), which tells Vagrant how to set up your virtual machine in VirtualBox.

To use the vagrant file, you will need to have done the following:

  1. Download and Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  2. Download and Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
  3. Install [Ansible](http://ansibleworks.com/) ([guide for installing Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html)).
  4. Open a shell prompt (Terminal app on a Mac) and cd into the folder containing the `Vagrantfile`
  5. Run the following command to install the necessary Ansible roles for this profile: `$ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.txt`

Once all of that is done, you can simply type in `vagrant up`, and Vagrant will create a new VM, install the base box, and configure it.

Once the new VM is up and running (after `vagrant up` is complete and you're back at the command prompt), you can log into it via SSH if you'd like by typing in `vagrant ssh`.

You should be able to access your new Drupal site at either the IP address of the VM (http://192.168.33.3/), or at http://drupal/ if you add the line `192.168.33.3  drupal` to your `/etc/hosts` file.
